    "question2": "How can AI improve my business processes?",

This leads to faster operations, reduced errors, and better resource allocation.",

    "question4": "How long does it take to implement business automation?",
    "answer4": "Implementation time varies depending on the complexity of your processes and the scope of automation. Simple automations can be deployed in weeks, while comprehensive business process automation projects may take several months. We provide detailed timelines during the consultation phase.",
    "question5": "What is the ROI of business process automation?",
    "answer5": "Most businesses see ROI within 6-12 months. Benefits include reduced labor costs (30-70%), fewer errors (up to 90% reduction), faster processing times (50-80% improvement), and improved customer satisfaction. The exact ROI depends on your specific processes and implementation scope."
